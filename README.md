## 🌿 Mental Health Agent System — Google Kaggle Capstone Project

## 🧠 Overview

This project is a **multi-agent mental health assistance system** built as part of the **Google Advanced Data Analytics Capstone (Kaggle)**.
It uses **Python**, **asyncio**, and a **parallel multi-agent pipeline** to analyze:

* Sentiment
* Emotion
* Safety signals
* User intent
* Response generation

The system simulates how an intelligent assistant could provide **safe, empathetic, and structured mental health support**.

## 🚀 Key Features

* **LLM-powered mental health assistant**
* **Parallel agent system** (sentiment, emotion, safety scanning run together)
* Async processing with `asyncio`
* Modular and expandable pipeline
* Clean project architecture ready for deployment
* Fully documented code in `src/main.py`
