5.Response generation

The system simulates how an intelligent assistant could provide safe, empathetic, and structured mental health support.

🚀 Key Features :

1. LLM-powered mental health assistant

2. Parallel agent system (sentiment, emotion, safety scanning run together)

3. Async processing with asyncio

4. Modular and expandable pipeline

5. Clean project architecture ready for deployment
